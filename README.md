Created a dynamic To-Do List Using JavaScript

initially there is a ADD button to add a new entry to the list.
List have 2 columns: DATE and DESCRIPTION

each row have a delete button on the right side which would delete a particular row.
On clicking the ADD button, 2 inputs should appear one for a calendar and one for Description, 2 options if user clicks CANCEL, it remove the input fields without any changes, but if user clicks OK then new rows create in the TO-DO List and the input fields disappear.
