Created a dynamic To-Do List Using JavaScript

initially there is ADD button to add a new entry to the list.
List have 2 columns: DATE and DESCRIPTION
List is sortable using any of the column.
Sorting work in ascending as well as in descending order.

each row have a delete button on the right side which would delete a particular row.

On clicking the ADD button, 2 inputs appear one for a calendar and one for Description, if user clicks CANCEL, it should remove the input fields without any changes, but if user clicks OK then new rows create in the TO-DO List and the input fields disappear.
